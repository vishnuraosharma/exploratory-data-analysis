## Overview

This repository contains code and resources related to exploratory data analysis (EDA) across topics that I find interesting. Right now the content is only about food, which should tell you a lot about me.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can either clone the repository to your local machine or explore the provided Jupyter notebooks online. I've organized (the) notebook (more to come!) based on topic and provided dataset CSV files are provided.

- Python (3.6+)
